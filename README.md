## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a database-driven system designed to manage learner performance in a language training program. It stores learner information, assessments, and scores, and uses PL/SQL functions, procedures, packages, triggers, and validation logic to ensure accuracy and integrity of the grading process.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Language training programs often struggle with inconsistent grading, manual score calculations, and data integrity issues when tracking learner progress across multiple assessments. This system addresses these challenges by providing an automated, reliable database solution that ensures accurate score management and maintains data consistency throughout the learning lifecycle.

---

## 🚀 Key Objectives

1. **Centralized Data Management** - Store and organize learner profiles, assessment records, and performance metrics in a structured relational database.

2. **Automated Score Calculation** - Utilize PL/SQL functions (e.g., `calculate_avg_score`) to automatically compute learner averages and performance indicators.

3. **Data Integrity & Validation** - Implement triggers and constraints to prevent invalid score entries and maintain database consistency.

4. **Efficient Data Processing** - Leverage PL/SQL packages, procedures, and bulk operations for organized score entry, reporting, and efficient data handling.

5. **Error Handling & Testing** - Incorporate comprehensive error-handling mechanisms and test cases to ensure safe and reliable grading operations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Oracle SQL** - Tables, Relations, Constraints, Indexes
- **PL/SQL** - Functions, Procedures, Packages, Cursors, Triggers
- **Bulk Operations** - Efficient data processing and batch updates
- **Exception Handling** - Robust error management
